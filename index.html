    <ul>
      <div class="list">
      <li> 6:15 am. wake up </li>
      <p> I feed my dog Margot and my cat Paisley as soon as I get up. I heat water to make tea after feeding them. Then, I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get dressed for the day.
      </li>
    <li> 6:45 am. walk dog </li>
      <p> I take Margot for a 30-minute walk every morning. She has way too much energy and needs to burn some before I leave for the day. We usually walk in my neighborhood in the morning.
      </p>
    <li> 7:15 am. breakfast</li>
      <p> After I get back from the walk I eat breakfast which is Greek yogurt with honey today. I ice and drink my tea that I brewed earlier.
      </p>
    <li> 7:30 am. catch up on work</li>
      <p> I start my day by responding to emails and planning my day. Afterwards, I work on projects like this one for Coder Girl and finish job applications. I spend a lot of time looking, applying and interviewing for new jobs.
        </p>
    <li> 10:30 am. studio visit</li>
      <p> The public relations manager at Craft Alliance stops by to shoot photographs of me working in my home studio for the catalog being made for the upcoming Artist-in-Residence Anniversary Exhibition. This is a quick visit. I find out that my piece will be on the postcard and the cover of the catalog. My work can be viewed at <a id=damia href= "http://www.damiasmith.com/">damiasmith.com</a>.
      </p>
    <li> 11:00 am. lunch</li>
      <p> I eat lunch before going to work, this week I have left-over quinoa chili. It is still kind of weird to eat my lunch so early, but I have to in order to make it to work on time.
        </p>
    <li> 11:15 am. bike to work</li>
      <p> I ride my bike to Craft Alliance to teach my summer camp. Itâ€™s better for me, my wallet and the environment.

    <ul>
      <div class= "list">
      <li> 12:00 pm. metals camp</li>
      <p> I get there early to prepare my materials and get everything set up. I am teaching 10 to 14 year-olds how to make metal jewelry and sculptures.
        </p>
    <li> 3:45 pm. bike home</li>
      <p> The ride home is less fun, but I avoid a lot of traffic. It only takes 10 more minutes to bike.
        </p>
    <li> 4:30 pm. pet check</li>
      <p> When I get home I need to feed my dog and cat and let Margot go outside in the backyard for a while. I usually need to rest for after biking home because it is so hot outside.
        </p>
    <li> 5:00 pm. more work</li>
      <p> I continue working on projects and job applications. Soon some of this time can be spent making a sculpture for my next show in January.

      <p> Margot gets a longer evening walk which is good for both of us. Tonight we walk to Soulard.
        </p>
    <li> 9:00 pm. dinner</li>
      <p> I make a salad with spinach, tomatoes, onions, avocado, and fake chicken (I'm a vegetarian) for dinner.
        </p>
    <li> 10:00 pm. shower</li>
      <p> I prefer showering in the evening.
        </p>
    <li> 10:30 pm. work</li>
      <p> I do more work and web surfing before going to bed.
        </p>
    <li> 11:30 pm. sleep</li>
      <p> I read a science-fiction novel Codebreakers before falling asleep.
