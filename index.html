  <h1> A Day in the Life... </h1>
 <body>
   <h2 class= "morning"> Morning</h2>

    <h3> 6:15 am Wake up </h3>
      <p> I feed my dog Margot and my cat Paisley as soon as I wake up. I heat water to make tea after feeding them. Then, I brush teeth, wash face, and get dressed for the day.
      </p>

    <h3> 6:45 am Walk Dog </h3>
      <p> I take Margot for a 30 minute walk every morning. She has way too much energy and need to burn some before I leave for the day.
      </p>
    <h3> 7:15 am Breakfast</h3>
      <p> After I get back I eat breakfast which is usually Greek yogurt with honey. I wash my dishes and prep my lunch for the day.
        </p>
    <h3> 7:30 am Catch up on Work</h3>
      <p> I start my day by responding to emails and planning my day. Afterwards, I will work on projects like this one for Launchcode or job applications.
        </p>
    <h3> 10:30 am Studio Visit</h3>
      <p> The Public Relations manager at Craft Alliance stops by to shoot photographs of me working in my home studio for the catalogue being made for the upcoming Artist-in-Residence Anniversary Exhibition.
        </p>
    <h3> 11:00 am Lunch</h3>
      <p> I make a simple lunch before going to work, this week I have left-over quinoa chili.
        </p>
    <h3> 11:15 am Bike to Work</h3>
      <p> I ride my bike to Craft Alliance to teach my summer camp. Itâ€™s better for me, my wallet and the environment.
        </p>
  <h2 class= "afternoon"> Afternoon </h2>

    <h3> 12:00 pm Metals Camp</h3>
      <p> I get there early to prepare my materials and get everything set up. I am teaching 10-14 year olds how to make metal jewelry and sculptures.
        </p>
    <h3> 3:45 pm Bike Home</h3>
      <p> The ride home is less fun, but I avoid a lot of traffic.
        </p>
    <h3> 4:30 pm Pet Check</h3>
      <p> When I get home I need to feed my dog and cat and let Margo go outside for a while.
        </p>
    <h3> 5:00 pm More Work</h3>
      <p> I continue working on projects and job applications. Soon some of this time can be spent making a sculpture for my next show in January.
        </p>
  <h2 class= "evening"> Evening </h2>

    <h3> 6:30 pm Lecture at the Pulitzer</h3>
      <p> I have been meaning to see the exhibition at the Pulitzer since it went up. It will be over in a week so I go see a lecture on decolonization of women and the exhibition.
        </p>
    <h3> 8:30 pm Walk Dog</h3>
      <p> Margot gets a longer evening walk which is good for both of us.
        </p>
    <h3> 9:30 pm Dinner</h3>
      <p> I make a simple salad for dinner.
        </p>
    <h3> 10:00 pm Shower</h3>
      <p> I prefer showering in the evening.
        </p>
    <h3> 10:30 pm Work</h3>
      <p> I do more work or web surfing before going to bed.
        </p>
    <h3> 11:30 pm Sleep</h3>
      <p> I read my science-fiction novel about coding before falling asleep.
